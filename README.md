# Principles of Operating Systems - Final Project

## Description

This tool is designed to perform efficient file searching across directories using multiple threads, enabling users to quickly find specific patterns within files.
Key Features

### The main features of this project include:
1. Parallel Searching: Utilizes multiple threads to search for patterns in files concurrently, significantly speeding up the search process.
2. Recursive Search: Supports recursive searching through directories, allowing users to search for patterns in nested folders.
3. Customizable Threads: Users can specify the number of threads to be used for parallel searching, enabling optimal resource utilization.
